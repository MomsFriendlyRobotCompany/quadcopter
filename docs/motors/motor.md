# Kv (Constant Velocity)

“Kv” refers to the constant velocity of a motor. It is measured by the number
of revolutions per minute (rpm) that a motor turns when 1V (one volt) is
applied with no load attached to that motor. The Kv rating of a brushless motor
is the ratio of the motor’s unloaded rpm to the peak voltage on the wires
connected to the coils.

Knowing the Kv rating of a motor will help you determine how fast that motor will rotate when a given voltage is applied to it. For example:

| a 980Kv motor powered by an 11.1V battery would spin at 10,878 rpm (980 x 11.1) with no load

A change in voltage will change the rpm and will require changing the propeller to avoid overloading the motor. Kv allows you to get a handle on the torque that can be expected from a particular motor. Torque is determined by the number of winds on the armature and the strength of the magnets. A low Kv motor has more winds of thinner wire—it will carry more volts at fewer amps, produce higher torque, and swing a bigger prop. A high Kv motor has fewer winds of thicker wire that carry more amps at fewer volts and spin a smaller prop at high revolutions.
